# Stereoscopics, nVidia 3dVision and their disconcerting policies.

## About this rant
This represents an open letter to nVidia

Dear nVidia,

I am one of these opensource guys who **was** lucky with nVidia
hardware for a very long time.

I'm essentially working with Linux distributions for decades and
the last GPU(board) which isn't tagged by 'nVidia',
was the voodoo2 - but you should know your own history at all.

## How you can help (and help yourself)
I read about your question how you could help out "Linux"
to be better supported. I'm using "Linux" here substitutionally for
any other platfrom than Windows. AOPTW does not stand for excluding
Windows, it represents the contrary of your latest policies.

## The answers in short, and the first one is simply essential:

1. Please just unlock openGL(+) quadbuffering on Geforces with all "drivers"
   finally. Most of us own Geforces and some of us know it's not only
   the "price" to avoid a Quadro, there are other reasons which I don't
   explain in detail at this position, but Quadros are optimizied
   for other targets, but that does not affect quadbuffering
   Please stop talking us into believing that Geforces don't have the
   capability of quadbuffering.

2. Please distribute the firmware of the glasses IR-Transmitter not
   like "Windows only".
   A simple direct download knitted with your disclaimer
   belonging to the use of shutterglasses (straight in general) should
   suit any wishes.
   Or you might just put a free distribution licence on it.
   I'm pretty sure this will keep you in community's favour.

3. Stop trying to hide secrets which aren't secrets.
   I have full understanding for keeping secrets belonging
   to new features in hardware and so on. But there's no reason to
   hide  things which are common and even your competitions
   know. I'm not demanding building plans etc.
   I prefer open sources at all, but I am using your proprietary
   Linux-"driver", which just works fine and stable, and I also appreciate
   the straight fixing log etc.

### Details
Your good Linux support in the past made me faithful.

I know that there are a lot of insults and disses belonging
to your latest policies, and I don't deem them here to be justly,
but I don't wonder about them.
Why are you compromising your good reputation?

I want to describe hard-headed what you should vary in future to
avoid that I'll become unfaithful, because my
recent(650 ti boost (and others - and next) GPU has to support
openGL+ quadbuffering.
There are a lot of queries concerning this point within your forums.
And when it comes to the question about quadbuffering with your
Linux-"driver", your mechanical answer is "supported on Quadro Cards".
Well, that is not a lie, but it becomes very smelly when looking more deeply.
It would be a lie, to tell us that it doesn't or won't work on
"Consumer" Cards. We know it works.

It's a (maybe unintended) discrimination against F/OSS and the real
industrial standards, and you nVidia manifestly forgot your reputation
to be the "openGL"-company, don't you?
In abstract you started **trying** to control F/OSS with this policy,
but the result will be the opposite and not what you might expect
by your limitations. - what I am trying to explain in detail.

Me and a lot of other with good technical background knowlegde knew
the whole time that there never was a _technical_ reason to limitate
quadbuffering to Quadros. One with less knowledge could believe
so, but if you'd be straight to yourself and to your CUSTOMERs,
you'll admit that this point is a matter of software, in that
case a matter of your driver. You officially conceded exactly that point
in May 15 by suddenly supporting your Geforces with openGL
quadbuffering. The really awful smelling thing is "Windows only".
I don't hate Windows, I hate things like Windows only.
Windows never has been a good reference and is far beyond what
I'd call "professional". I am sorry for that view but its based on
profound knowledge of the trade and just another story which is
at issue tangentially.

## *Where* is the point to cripple standards?
Did you expect opensource people to buy expensive Quadros,
while they mostly know that your modern Geforces are "better"
because of their targets?
Geforces are used in professional environments, too, what is
hard to slip. To be honest, you're disgracing yourself by trying to mark
quadbuffering to be a "professional" feature, dear nVidia.
And we already know who tried to kill "Quadbuffering" in the past.

Some want to tell us "Quadbuffering" is dead. I say, quadbuffering
is that thing we need in future. I don't wonder that "virtual reality"
is still a nerdy nichy.
And then there were unsuspecting voices within your forums, that
one just could buy "Windows" to have openGL quadbuffering,
which would be "cheaper" than a quadro.

Yes strike, having this snakeoil-catapult is the way to deal with openGL.
Could you hear the broad laughter?
It's just a boldness to support openGL-things on Windows only!
I don't want to bash against Windows, I just don't want to use it
anymore and I don't want to discuss that point. That all does not
mean that I want to exclude Windows from being there, for the sake
of varity I am fine with its existence, and finally we are talking
about a **platform-independent** API here.

It's still anyone's guess why you crippled the openGL quadbuffer support on
Geforce products lastly for Linux & Co, but it is too obvios [...],
and you should not wonder about getting more and more "fingers" time by time,
while you just handicap and discriminate those people who are doing
the real standards and give many impulses for new things at all.
Any company benefit from *open* scientific standards and pretending so if
everything comes from a company itself is the best way leading into insignificance.

nVidia, just come back to roots.

You're still building good hardware and drivers, and
there was a good interaction succinctly between open and closed
development in the past.
Evidently some PR-people and so called managers forgot
about that, might be owing to the fact that they do not have
(any) technical knowledge and begin to lie or coming up with totally wrong
decisions. "Windows only" was/is/will be a wrong decision.
It also always has been a wrong decision to ostracise the opensource-world.
I don't write this all to tell you that I want you to
through out an opensource-driver, then again it's a
very good idea to help out the nouveau-devs on the other hand of course.
I know that this is a tightrope walk between innovation and common,
but denying any cooperation is another evidence of incapacity and
also another question which I won't expatiate here.

And now I am going to point out some well-intentioned advice.
Mainly I want you to support the openGL(+) quadbuffering
on Linux _and_ Geforces, and do so without letting developers having
a "unlock-key" for the api. It's just about your shutter-glasses
in the end. It's no secret how they work, neither
in abstract nor in technical details, I'd be able to write
down the hardware specs for your shutter-glasses including the
IR-pcm things, but that's definitivly your job, I am
just a customer who gave you money, last but no least for two of your
shutter glasses, and a lot of Geforces in the past. And now you want me,
to buy a very expensive Quadro, to have a standard quadbuffering pipe,
because I am using Linux? No, thank you!
It's not a pondering silence from your site, is it?
Hopefully it's now.

We managed to have example software which controls the glasses even
with 60Hz in vertical and doublebuffering and windowed. But keeping the frames and
their "correct" eye-render process in sync is just possible by "terrible" hacks
without quadbuffering.
 a) "terrible" because not platform-independent
.b) "terrible" because even I do not want shuttering
     with a vertical raster scan lower than 100Hz.

All your customer care things e.g. tending to "120Hz" with shuttering
have my sympathy, but it is just a small part of "virtual reality",
and a part of a way to an aim.
There are a lot of projects which we could modify for stereoscopics
_and_ your shutters besides the other projection types.
We won't claim them to be "3dvision-ready", but we would mark
them as "supports nvidia shutter glasses".
After you have rechecked those projects, you are free to mark
them "3DVision ready" or better give them another "PR-Name".
Supporting your hardware in a multiple-tracked manner
is a good idea, because multiple-tracked is always a good idea.
Is there a better way to have a good promotion without any
expenses?

I understand that your "3DVision" is the concept hooking an
Dx3D scene and associated with "gaming under windows".
No problem!
In the opposite all the openGL things have to be rewritten/modified
in parts to support stereoscopics, because
there are a variety of methods of creating the "stereo pairs".
Hooking a "simple" game-engine with two planes is the one thing, supporting
stereoscopics nativly another, for sure you know all that.
There are things to develop and to define concerning stereoscopics,
but we cannot while you give us that circumcised and crippled API.

As I stated above, shutters require quadbuffering to be
platform-independent. Any other stereo projection type
doesn't, BUT quadbuffering makes it all easier.
And there are a lot really good GL coders out there, guess
what their main development platform and GPU-hardware is!

For sure this all is not only your part, and not your responsibilty
in the matter of "health". I am sure we all always will disclaim
these things in a way which suits you as company fine, too.
I'm raising this point, because it *might* be reason for the
artificial limitations.
And it is **your** part to support your hardware by giving us
an API, otherwise the hardware becomes worthless.

## Blacklisting own products
Lack of quadbuffering on modern gpu-boards is just very much
beyond any comprehension.
We are talking about GPU-RAM memory management which
is already part of your driver. After all my researching I am
sure that you just need to re-modify a blacklist within
your driver, and overall I wonder that you blacklist your
own products. There's no better way to trip yourself up.
What the heck is going on within your manangement?

## Retrieving situation and harmony
Support quadbuffering at all.
Flag it as an experimental feature, which is not
enabled by default (like you do under Windows),
if you are afraid of any "warranty" things.

What about unlocking quadbuffering by

Option "Stereo" "xx"

within xorg.conf?

One of this option value could be there just to enable the quadbuffer pipe.
To be exact, we even *would* not need your Linux-driver to take
care about the IR-Transmitter within openGL applications. The value
of 10 e.g. makes my acer tft sending the pcm, but we need to have the
ability to control the swapping. I don't expect that this is
new to you.
We just don't want to beg you for an api key to make
things like celestia and many other cool platform-independent projects
ready for stereoscopic view - with your shutterglasses.
BTW. I got it to work without quadbuffering on my geforce, but I want
software like celestia to be platform-independent, and your policy
inhibits exactly this point, too. What a mess! That's all against
your commitment "not to forget the 'Linuxer'".
Broken promises result in boon not bane.

Letting user/customer decide what they want is the way,
and it's not only me who is fed up to the back teeth with
the policies where user/customer has no choices.
And we all know where that latter evil mentality comes
from - don't nVidia - don't follow these fatheads.

The second thing is the firmware for the IR-transmitter.
It's already "freely" available but again "Windows only".
Why?
You won't hurt yourself to host the binary as single file
to be used with any software.
Nobody else than your CUSTOMERs would take advantage of that firmware.
Wait, we could use your glasses with GPUs from your competitions.
Well, **the** reason to do so, is **your** policy "Quadro only".
This policy is just scaring away some of your important
customers. You're management might think it's a minor problem to loose
a "few" customers. But I am talking about those few "customers"
who recommended your hardware for a very long time.

It's even a question of time, when the opensource community has
its own firmware for the IR-Transmitter. Would you sue any
customer for doing things with _their_ property?

So why are you kicking the OSS-development at all in the teeth
instead of carry on binding them to your products?
I am against dependencies in general, so you might ask
yourself, why I ask you **such** a question.


### Shutters and health:
There are several issues of course. IMHO there never will
be really serious harms. It's all about getting sick from
"stereoscopics" at all, or getting headache from any kind
of "flickering". If one is affected, he just won't use
the things. There will be no harms with lasting effects.
Some say, e.g. looking at crosseyed-stereos harms the
health. That's not true. Squinting is just viewing
by design. It's more or less weary, nothing more.
Something like squinting is more strenuous when one's
eye-muscles are not trained.
And also any kind of flickering is just weary and not harming
human health with lasting-effects.
We all just have to put out warnings in the sense of hints
for using shutterglasses at all. Even with 120Hz we have
30Hz flickering on each eye, right? Nobody could rule
out a sickness or a headache while using *this*
or even more while using any electronics in general. 

### just another "guess"
Well, I just remembered that you has been settled down in a
country where people sued fabricators for dead cats in microwaves.
A shiny example for an amok running legal system.
There *might* be a spurious correlation between something like
that and the missing quadbuffering, but there isn't - hopefully.
If so, you should think about moving to a country where something
like that is clearly declared as nonsense.

##Conclusion
Supporting quadbuffering in general represents your
*unique selling proposition*. It poses your
top-ranked card in the market, just draw that card.
It will also keep your independence, better to say
you'll recapture your independence, because it's too
obvios that you are not independent in a way you better
should be. And sure, there are basicly always dependencies
in general.
Anyway, we all should always ensure that these a reduced
to a minimum. This should be on of the big similarities
among you and the F/OSS community.

Put the fun back on computing, nVidia!
Thank you in advance.
