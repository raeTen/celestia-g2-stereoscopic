Compiler issue fixes:
I am not very experienced with qmake, but this may help you with
compiling cmod-tools, and help "qmake"-devs to fix in better manner

If you get errors while compiling the cmod tools in

src/tools/cmod
you might try:
    (after qmake within)

    First: Copy (or move) all files
        FROM src/tools/cmod/common TO
        src/tools/cmod/3dstocmod
        (maybe changing the makefile will do the job, too)

    Compiler complains about not finding "io.h" [cmodsphere]
        replace
        #<include io.h>         with
        #<include sys/io.h>     in
        cmodsphere.cpp

    Linker complains about undefined references to glu_Things... [cmodviews]
        Edit src/tools/cmod/cmodviews/makefile
        APPEND to the line which begins with "LIBS" (after -lpthread)
        -lglut -lGLU

    Compiler complains "exit" not in that scope... [itokawa]
        Edit src/tools/cmod/itokawa/txt2cmod.cpp
        ADD the line
        #include <cstdlib>
        (below the one #include <iostream>

after "Make" that, I had all those nice tools up and running...
btw "make install" didn't work, too.

Missing parameters for "qmake"?
